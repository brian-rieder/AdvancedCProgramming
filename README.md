# AdvancedCProgramming
Re-done solutions repository for Purdue's ECE264 class that I took in Spring 2014. This was done both as a personal exercise to keep sharp on C programming and data structures as well as to upload a more apt skill benchmark.

All solutions here are explicitly mine, Brian Rieder, and should not be used by any students in the event of assignment reusage in future semesters.

Due to restructure of the course, I have chosen to make this repository open-source. In the event of contact by an instructor, this repository will be closed.


To-do List:
Copy Spring 2014 problems into a folder in repository... https://github.com/yunghsianglu/ECE264Assignments/tree/master/Spring2014

Solutions to be added:
PA06-IntegerPartitioning-Recursion.c
PA07-MergeSort.c
PA08-RecursionInTrees.c
PA09-HuffmanDecoding.c
PA10-StackSortAndTreeShapes.c
PA11-PuzzleSolver.c
PA12-ThreadedPrimalityTest.c
